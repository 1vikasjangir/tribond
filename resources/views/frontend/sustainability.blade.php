			<h3>KEY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS</h3>
			<p>Environmental impacts are the key issues and needs affecting the local and wider environment in which your business operates. Direct impacts include local pollution of air or water or land from factories or offices. More indirect impacts are impacts such as climate change from electricity consumption, deforestation from unsustainable timber, plastic or paper use. </p>
			<p>Below are the key environmental impacts which form the basis of our environmental  action plans list. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Paper consumption in product manufacturing </li>
				<li>Fossil fuel-based plastics consumption in product manufacturing </li>
				<li>Steel consumption in product manufacturing </li>
				<li>Electricity consumption – primarily factory but also office</li>
				<li>Fuel consumption – gas or vehicle petrol/diesel </li>
				<li>Waste management – primarily factory but also office </li>
				<li>Water consumption – factory </li>
				<li>Business travel – supplier visits and staff commuting</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Key social impacts</h3>
			<p>Social impacts are the key issues and needs affecting the communities in which your business operates. Direct impacts include those in the workplace: equality, diversity and inclusion, health and wellbeing of employees, safety and skills development; those in the marketplace - treatment of suppliers and customers and then support for your local community.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Employee health and safety – both direct (factory/office) and indirect supply chain – UK and Global</li>
				<li>Employee wellbeing and human rights – both direct (factory/office) and indirect supply chain – UK and Global </li>
				<li>Employee equality and diversity – both direct (factory/office) and indirect supply chain – UK and Global</li>
				<li>Ethical trading – supplier engagement and terms, both UK and overseas </li>
				<li>Product safety</li>
				<li>Community engagement and giving</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We are currently in the process of formalising and integrating our sustainability approach. We are working with expert independent consultants to prioritise, measure and manage environmental and social impacts, put in place management systems and engage our people, suppliers and customers. Please contact James Boatwright, Company Director, for further information.</p>
