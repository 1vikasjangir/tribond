                <h2>VIRTUAL TOURS</h2>
                <p>What better way to present point of purchase ideas or full fit-out / shopfitting projects, than in virtual reality. If you’ve got a Quest headset we can send you files to experience our designs in a virtual world environment. What better way to truly feel the impact of our concepts. If you don’t have a headset, fear not, it’s also awesome to experience  it online. Check-out some of the examples below. Just click to move around.</p>

                    <p>Don’t be surprised if we ask you to send us some demo products. We’re not after freebies - we just like to test out what we’re making. We can just use weights, but it is not the same. We like to load up our prototypes with actual products, not only to test the functionality of the display stand but to gauge visually if everything is as expected.</p>

                    <p>We have a large setup facility onsite in Cambridge to demo everything before production alongside our new office in London.</p>

                    <p>Once the prototypes are signed off, and production prices have been agreed upon, we’ll work with our global supply chain to manufacture your display stands. We’ll talk with you through the process and keep you updated with producing timings as we go. </p>

                    <p>We’ll also work with external QC professionals to ensure the quality of your displays meet expectations. We’ll finalise packaging details during production and, if required, carry out drop testing. </p>
