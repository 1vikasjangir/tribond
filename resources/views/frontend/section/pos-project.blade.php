                        <p>The ultimate goal of any point of purchase (POP) display is to get your product noticed,

                        <p>We understand products are different, and price points make consumers’ shopping experiences
                            very different. It’s the point of purchase that has seconds to grab the shopper’s attention,
                            educate them and intrigue them enough to pick the product up. Once it’s picked up, more
                            often than not, it goes in the trolley. From concept through to completion, we work together
                            with you from the offset to deliver point of purchase displays that enhance the in-store
                            shopping experience for your customers and ultimately deliver your business a measurable

                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <p>This is one of the most important questions when designing a concept for a point of purchase
                            project. There are no limitations to material choices within Big Instore, so we’re working
                            blind without a budget. Give us a budget, and we can choose the most appropriate material
                            for the job and even consider if tech is an option to include. </p>

                        <p>It’s important to note that just because you’ve given us a high budget - doesn’t mean we’ll
                            use it, but it does allow us to push boundaries when coming up with ideas. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6 d-sm-none d-block">

                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <p>Again, another key player in our designs’ direction. Factors like temperature, draft &
                            environment make a massive difference to the substrate we choose to design your display
                            stand project from. We’ll want to ensure the display stand we design will last the term
                            you’re selling products for.</p>

                        <p>It’s not just the physical environment that’s important to note, but the competing products
                            or brands in the same space. How are they merchandising their products? Do you want to
                            appear as the cheaper alternative or as an equal or more premium version? Sharing
                            information like this helps massively.</p>

                        <p>We consider SEG Lightboxes among the most primitive tech types - but we love them. Updating
